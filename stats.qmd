<h1> Statistical Analysis </h1>

To evaluate the differences and similarities between the legacy **MODIS-Aqua** primary productivity product and the interim **VIIRS-SNPP** and **VIIRS-NOAA20** products, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis.

The analysis includes:

- [**Unbiased Relative Difference (&psi;)**](#unbiased-relative-difference) & [**Biased Relative Difference (&Delta;<sub>rel</sub>)**](#biased-relative-difference) $\Rightarrow$ Measures how VIIRS compares to MODIS without and with bias.
- [**Pearson Correlation Coefficients & P-values**](#pearson-correlation-coefficients) $\Rightarrow$  Evaluates how VIIRS follows MODIS over time.
- [**Linear Regression Trends & P-values**](#linear-regression-trends) $\Rightarrow$  Identifies long-term changes in productivity.
- [**Contingency Matrices**](#contingency-matrices) $\Rightarrow$  Measures trend agreement across datasets.

## Unbiased Relative Difference (&psi;)

The unbiased relative difference (&psi;<sup>netPP</sup>) of the interim VIIRS netPP (netPP<sub>VIIRS</sub>) and legacy MODIS netPP (netPP<sub>MODIS</sub>) products was calculated to assess the consistency in netPP estimates between interim VIIRS and legacy MODIS datasets. This metric provides validation that the interim netPP products can be reliably used for continuity in long-term productivity analyses.

For a detailed explanation of the calculation, see the [Appendix](#psi_appendix).

**Figure 1.** Global maps of the monthly mean unbiased relative difference ($\bar{\psi}_{lat/lon}$) comparing MODIS-Aqua with VIIRS-SNPP (top) and VIIRS-NOAA20 (bottom). Positive values indicate higher VIIRS estimates; negative values indicate lower VIIRS estimates.
:::

The lighter blue and yellow regions in **Fig. 1** suggest strong agreement between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS netPP estimates, particularly in mid-latitude open ocean regions where differences are relatively small. This reinforces that VIIRS provides a reliable continuation of MODIS-based estimates in these areas.

- **Dark blue (positive $\bar{\psi}_{lat/lon}$) regions** $\Rightarrow$ VIIRS estimates are **higher** than MODIS.
- **Dark red (negative $\bar{\psi}_{lat/lon}$) regions** $\Rightarrow$ VIIRS estimates are **lower** than MODIS.

Most regions exhibit slightly higher VIIRS estimates, with larger disagreements in coastal upwelling zones and polar regions, where environmental factors and sensor differences may contribute to variability.

Despite these regional differences, the overall agreement between MODIS and VIIRS is strong, ensuring that users can confidently transition to the interim VIIRS-based primarily productivity products.

:::

In both sensor comparisons, the **Arabian Sea Province (ARAB)** consistently shows the **strongest agreement** with an absolute mean unbiased relative difference of **-0.0013**. This suggests minimal deviation between the sensors.

In contrast, the **North Pacific Subtropical Water Province (NPSW)** exhibits the **weakest agreement**, with a significantly higher absolute mean unbiased relative difference of **0.1130**, indicating that **VIIRS-SNPP and NOAA20 tend to overestimate netPP** in this region.

Overall, the ARAB province consistently exhibits the strongest agreement, while the NPSW province experiences the greatest discrepancies.

## Absolute Relative Difference (&Delta;<sub>rel</sub>)

The absolute relative difference (&Delta;<sub>rel</sub>) provides an alternative measure of variation between MODIS and VIIRS netPP estimates, revealing patterns of overestimation or underestimation between MODIS and VIIRS. The absolute relative difference directly shows the magnitude of disagreement between MODIS and VIIRS.

For a detailed explanation of the calculation, see the [Appendix](#delta_appendix).

### Spatial Variability in the Timeseries Monthly &Delta; Mean

**Figure 4.** Global maps of the monthly mean absolute relative difference ($\bar{\Delta}_{lat/lon}$) comparing MODIS-Aqua with VIIRS-SNPP (top) and VIIRS-NOAA20 (bottom). Positive values indicate higher VIIRS estimates; negative values indicate lower VIIRS estimates.
:::

The light blue and yellow regions in **Fig. 4** indicate that VIIRS and MODIS netPP estimates are relatively similar in most mid-latitude open ocean regions.

- **Dark blue (positive $\bar{\Delta}_{lat/lon}$) regions** $\Rightarrow$ VIIRS **overestimates** netPP compared to MODIS.
- **Dark red (negative $\bar{\Delta}_{lat/lon}$) regions** $\Rightarrow$ VIIRS **underestimates** netPP compared MODIS.

The **largest overestimations** occur in equitorial upwelling zones, where VIIRS reports significantly higher productivity than MODIS. In contrast, polar regions and coastal upwelling zones show the **most pronounced underestimations**, indicating lower VIIRS estimates relative to MODIS.

VIIRS-SNPP aligns more closely with MODIS than VIIRS-NOAA20, however both VIIRS sensor demonstrate consistent spatial patterns, reflecting that they can be used for long-term productivity analyses. 

## Linear Regression Trends

In order to identify temporal patterns in primary productivity, linear regression trends are calculated at each pixel (latitude and longitude) over a timeseries of monthly data. This approach allows us to visualize spatial patterns of change and evaluate how different satellite sensors track long-term primary productivity patterns. For this analysis, trends between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP were calculated over a 10-year period (2013-2018; 120 months), while trends between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20 were calculated over a 5-year period (2018-2022; 60 months). The maps shown below provide a visual comparison of these trends between MODIS-Aqua and the VIIRS sensors, highlighting regions of agreement and disagreement.

While the maps are useful for visually identifying patterns, a more quantitative assessment of agreement is provided through [contingency matrices and Cohen's Kappa statistics](#contingency-matrices-and-cohens-kappa).

For a detailed explanation of the calculations, see the [Appendix](#trends_appendix).

:::

The comparison of MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP in **Fig 5.** shows **strong overall agreement** in primary productivity trends, with VIIRS-SNPP displaying fewer extreme changes in magnitude. Most differences in trends occur primarily in the coastal upwelling zones and polar regions, where MODIS-Aqua tends to show slightly more intense positive or negative trends. In the open ocean regions, trends are weaker demonstrating high spatial agreement between both sensors. This suggests that SNPP produces trend estimates that align closely with MODIS estimates, providing users with confidence that VIIRS-SNPP can **reliably replace** MODIS-Aqua for long-term primary productivity analyses.

**Figure 6.** Linear trends in monthly primary productivity from MODIS-Aqua (top) and VIIRS-NOAA20 (bottom) datasets (2018-2022). Positive values (blue) indicate increasing trends in netPP, while negative values (red) indicate decreasing trends.
:::

The comparison of MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20 in **Fig 6.** also shows **strong overall agreement** in primary productivity trends. However, compared to **Fig 5.**, the MODIS-Aqua - VIIRS-NOAA20 pairing shows more widespread and stronger positive trends (dark blue) specifically in the polar regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Areas of strong negative trends (dark red) for both sensors are concentrated in coastal upwelling zones, particulary off the coasts of Northwest Africa, Peru, and Arabian Sea, though MODIS shows slightly higher intensities. In contrast, trends in open ocean regions are generally weaker and show a high degree of spatial consistency between MODIS and NOAA20. The consistent temporal patterns captured by both sensors support VIIRS-NOAA20 as a **reliable continuation** of the MODIS record for long-term primary productivity analyses. 

### Contingency Matrices and Cohen's Kappa

The contingency matrix categorizes each pixel by direction of the trend - positive, negative, or not statistically significant - across both datasets. 

The rows correspond to VIIRS classifications, and the columns to MODIS-Aqua classifications:

- **n.s.** = No significant trend  
- **β > 0** = Statistically significant positive trend  
- **β < 0** = Statistically significant negative trend

Each cell in the matrix contains the **percentage of pixels** that share that classification combination.

Cohen's Kappa then summarizes the overall agreement, accounting for agreement due to chance and offering a standardized measure of consistency between MODIS and VIIRS trend classifications.

| **Kappa Value** | **Interpretation**        |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| < 0.00          | No agreement              |
| 0.00–0.20       | Slight agreement          |
| 0.21–0.40       | Fair agreement            |
| 0.41–0.60       | Moderate agreement        |
| 0.61–0.80       | Substantial agreement     |
| 0.81–1.00       | Almost perfect agreement  |

**Figure 7.** Global contingency table comparing MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP, along with Cohen's Kappa statistic.
:::

The key takeaways for **Fig. 7** are:

- **75.9%** of pixels show **no significant trend** in either sensor (top-left cell).
- **11.4%** of pixels show a **positive trend** in both MODIS and SNPP (center cell).
- **5.0%** of pixels show a **negative trend** in both sensors (bottom-right cell).

These diagonal cells reflect cases where MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP agree on the direction and significance of the trend. In total, these agreements account for approximately **92.3%** of all valid ocean pixels, indicating a **very high level of agreement** between the two.

A Cohen's Kappa value of **0.77** indicates **“substantial agreement”** between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-SNPP trend classifications.

**Figure 8.** Global contingency table comparing MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20, along with Cohen's Kappa statistic.
:::

The key takeaways for **Fig. 8** are:

- **76.5%** of pixels show **no significant trend** in either sensor (top-left cell).
- **13.3%** of pixels show a **positive trend** in both MODIS and NOAA20 (center cell).
- **4.1%** of pixels show a **negative trend** in both sensors (bottom-right cell).

These diagonal cells represent agreement between MODIS and NOAA20. Together, they account for approximately **93.9%** of all pixels, a **very high level of agreement**.

A Cohen's Kappa value of **0.82** indicates **"almost perfect agreement"**, meaning that MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS-NOAA20 classify the direction and significance of productivity trends similarly far more often than would be expected by chance alone.

Both VIIRS sensors show strong agreement with MODIS-Aqua in classifying long-term primary productivity trends with Cohen's Kappa values that indicate substantial to almost perfect agreement. This confirms that both VIIRS-SNPP and VIIRS-NOAA20 are reliable successors to MODIS for long-term primary productivity analyses.

## Appendix

The following sections provide detailed explanations of how the statistical analyses between the legacy and interim products were calculated. If you are interested in exploring or replicating these analyses yoursel, check out our [Code Gallery](user_resources.qmd) for step-by-step tutorials. 

### Unbiased Relative Difference (&psi;) {#psi_appendix}

The pixel-by-pixel **unbiased relative difference (&psi;<sup>netPP</sup>)** was computed for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across [two datasets.](#download-statistical-analysis-data-products)

The unbiased relative difference (&psi;<sup>netPP</sup>) is calculated for each pixel as follows:

<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: black;  font-size: 1.5em;">
  $ψ^{netPP} = \frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{\left(\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} + netPP_{MODIS}}{2}\right)}$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The difference between VIIRS-based netPP (<i>netPP<sub>VIIRS</sub></i>) and MODIS-based netPP (<i>netPP<sub>MODIS</sub></i>) values for that pixel is divided by the mean of <i>netPP<sub>VIIRS</sub></i> and <i>netPP<sub>MODIS</sub></i>.</li>
</ul>

This metric allows for sensor-to-sensor consistency assessment, ensuring that variations are not biased by absolute magnitude differences.

### Absolute Relative Difference (&Delta;<sub>rel</sub>) {#delta_appendix}

The pixel-by-pixel **absolute relative difference (&Delta;<sub>rel</sub>)** was created for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across [two datasets.](#download-statistical-analysis-data-products)

The absolute relative difference (&Delta;<sup>netPP</sup>) is calculated for each pixel as follows:

<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 1.5em;">
  $\Delta^{netPP} = \frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{netPP_{MODIS}}$
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The difference between VIIRS-based netPP (<i>netPP<sub>VIIRS</sub></i>) and MODIS-based netPP (<i>netPP<sub>MODIS</sub></i>) values for that pixel is divided by <i>netPP<sub>MODIS</sub></i>.</li>
</ul>

This metric is useful for identifying systematic overestimations or underestimations in primary productivity estimates between the sensors. 

### Linear Regression Trends {#trends_appendix}

The purpose of calculating **linear regression trends** for each of the datasets is to evaluate how much the products agree or disagree in temporal patterns. Linear trends were calculated in the time series of monthly primary productivity for every pixel with either raw data or anomalies for the [MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP, and VIIRS-NOAA20 datasets](#download-statistical-analysis-data-products). Finding trends using raw data helps to analyze the absolute agreement in primary productivity estimates between the datasets, whereas calculating with anomalies enables us to focus on trends by removing seasonality. P-values were calculated to test the statistical significance of the trends for each pixel.

The trend analysis follows methods outlined in [Melin et al. 2017](#references), see the section 2.3 "Trend estimates and comparison of trends".

### Contingency Matrix and Cohen’s Kappa {#tables_appendix}

To quantitatively assess agreement in trend classifications between MODIS-Aqua and the VIIRS sensors, we use a **contingency matrix** and compute **Cohen’s Kappa**.

A contingency matrix compares the **direction of linear trends** between two datasets—MODIS and VIIRS—at each pixel. Each trend is classified into one of three categories:

- **Positive trend**: statistically significant increasing trend  
- **Negative trend**: statistically significant decreasing trend  
- **No significant trend**: slope not significantly different from zero (e.g., *p* > 0.05)

We then count how often each combination occurs across all pixels to build a 3×3 matrix:

|                     | VIIRS Positive | VIIRS Negative | VIIRS No Trend |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **MODIS Positive**  | a              | b              | c              |
| **MODIS Negative**  | d              | e              | f              |
| **MODIS No Trend**  | g              | h              | i              |

- **Diagonal cells** (a, e, i) indicate agreement.
- **Off-diagonal cells** indicate disagreement.

#### Cohen’s Kappa: Measuring Agreement Beyond Chance

**Cohen’s Kappa (κ)** quantifies how much the agreement between MODIS and VIIRS exceeds what would be expected by chance. It ranges from:

- **1** = perfect agreement  
- **0** = no better than random

<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size: 1.5em;">
  $\kappa = \frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e}$
  </p>
</blockquote>

Where:

- **\( P_o \)** = observed agreement (proportion of pixels where MODIS and VIIRS agree):

$$
P_o = \frac{a + e + i}{N}
$$

- **\( P_e \)** = expected agreement by chance:

$$
P_e = \frac{(a + b + c)(a + d + g) + (d + e + f)(b + e + h) + (g + h + i)(c + f + i)}{N^2}
$$

- **\( N \)** = total number of valid pixels (sum of all cells):

$$
N = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i
$$
