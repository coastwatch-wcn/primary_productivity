    "text": "Unbiased Relative Difference (ψ)\n\n\nThe unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) of the interim VIIRS netPP (netPPVIIRS) and legacy MODIS netPP (netPPMODIS) products was calculated to track the similarities in netPP values between interim VIIRS and legacy MODIS datasets. This provides validation that the interim netPP products can be reliably used for continuity in long-term productivity analyses.\n\n\nThe pixel-by-pixel unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) was created for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets:\n\nUnbiased Relative Difference, VIIRS-SNPP - MODIS-Aqua Global, Monthly, 9km, 2013-2022\nUnbiased Relative Difference, VIIRS-NOAA20 - MODIS-Aqua Global, Monthly, 9km, 2018-2022\n\nThe unbiased relative difference (ψnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(ψ^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{\\left(\\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} + netPP_{MODIS}}{2}\\right)}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by the mean of netPPVIIRS and netPPMODIS.\n\n\n\nComparing the Best and Worst Fit Longhurst Provinces\n\n \n\nOver the entire ten-year timeseries (2013-2022), the ARAB province (green) had the lowest absolute mean absolute ψnetPP (-0.0013), indicating the strongest agreement between MODIS-AQUA and VIIRS-SNPP. The NPSW province (black) had the highest absolute mean absolute ψnetPP (0.1130), indicating weak agreement between the sensors, with VIIRS-SNPP consistently overestimating netPP in this province.\n\n \n\nSimilarly, the five-year timeseries between MODIS-AQUA and VIIRS-NOAA20 showed the ARAB province (green) had the lowest absolute mean absolute ψnetPP (-0.0013) and the NPSW province (black) had the highest absolute mean absolute ψnetPP (0.1130). For both comparisons of MODIS-AQUA and the two interim products, the strongest agreement between the sensors is in the ARAB province and the weakest is in the NPSW province.\n\n\nAbsolute Relative Difference (Δrel)\n\n\nThe mean absolute relative difference (Δrel) of the interim VIIRS netPP product (netPPVIIRS) and legacy MODIS netPP product (netPPMODIS) was calculated.\n\n\nThe pixel-by-pixel mean absolute difference (Δrel) was created for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets:\n\nAbsolute Relative Difference, VIIRS-SNPP - MODIS-Aqua Global, Monthly, 9km, 2013-2022\nAbsolute Relative Difference, VIIRS-NOAA20 - MODIS-Aqua Global, Monthly, 9km, 2018-2022\n\nThe absolute relative difference (ΔnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(\\Delta^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{netPP_{MODIS}}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by netPPMODIS.\n\n\n\nCorrelations\n\n\nThe purpose of calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient is to assess the agreement and disagreement across time and space between the MODIS and VIIRS datasets. Raw data and anomalies were used to calculate the correlation coefficents. Calculating the correlation coefficients with raw data enables us to evaluate the absolute agreement in primary productivity estimates, whereas calculating with anomalies helps to focus on trends by removing seasonality. P-values were calculated to test the statistical significance of the Pearson correlation coefficient for each pixel.\n\n\nThe Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for each pixel over the time dimension for each of these datasets:\n\nPrimary Productivity, MODIS-AQUA, Science Quality, Global, 9km, 2013-2022 (Monthly Composite)\nPrimary Productivity, VIIRS-SNPP, Science Quality, Global, 9km, 2013-2022 (Monthly Composite)\nPrimary Productivity, VIIRS-NOAA20, Science Quality, Global, 9km, 2018-2022 (Monthly Composite)\n\nThe Pearson’s correlation coefficent is calculated for each pixel over all time steps for raw data as follows:\n\n\n\n\\[\n  r_{i,j} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^N (X_{t,i,j} - \\bar{X}_{i,j})(Y_{t,i,j} - \\bar{Y}_{i,j})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{t=1}^N (X_{t,i,j} - \\bar{X}_{i,j})^2 \\cdot \\sum_{t=1}^N (Y_{t,i,j} - \\bar{Y}_{i,j})^2}}\n  \\]\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nr i , j : Pearson correlation coefficient for the pixel (i, j).\n\n\nX t, i, j : Value from dataset X (MODIS) at time t for pixel (i, j).\n\n\nY t, i, j : Value from dataset Y (VIIRS) at time t for pixel (i, j).\n\n\nX̄ i, j : Mean of X t, i, j  over all t for pixel (i, j).\n\n\nȲ i, j : Mean of Y t, i, j  over all t for pixel (i, j).\n\n\nN: Number of time points (number of months).\n\n\n\nThe Pearson’s correlation coefficent is calculated for each pixel over all time steps for anomalies as follows:\n\n\n\n\\[\n  r_{i,j} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^N \\left(X'_{t,i,j} \\cdot Y'_{t,i,j}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{t=1}^N \\left(X'_{t,i,j}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\sum_{t=1}^N \\left(Y'_{t,i,j}\\right)^2}}\n  \\]\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nr i , j : Pearson correlation coefficient for the pixel (i, j).\n\n\nX’ t, i, j : Anomaly of dataset X (MODIS) at time t for pixel (i, j) calculated as:\n\nX’ t, i, j  = X  t, i, j  - ClimatologyX( i, j  month(t))\n\n\nY’ t, i, j : Anomaly of dataset Y (VIIRS) at time t for pixel (i, j) calculated as:\n\nY’ t, i, j  = Y t, i, j  - ClimatologyY( i, j  month(t))\n\n\n\nN: Number of time points (number of months).\n\n\n\nTrends\n\n\nThe purpose of calculating linear trends for each of the datasets is to evaluate how much the products agree or disagree over time and across regions. Linear trends were calculated in the time series of monthly primary productivity for each pixel with either raw data or anomalies for the MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP, and VIIRS-NOAA20 datasets. Finding trends using raw data helps to analyze the absolute agreement in primary productivity estimates between the datasets, whereas calculating with anomalies enables us to focus on trends by removing seasonality. P-values were calculated to test the statistical significance of the trends for each pixel.\n\n\nThe trend analysis follows methods outlined in Melin et al. 2017, see the section 2.3 “Trend estimates and comparison of trends”:\n\nMélin, F., V. Vantrepotte, A. Chuprin, M. Grant, T. Jackson, and S. Sathyendranath. 2017. Assessing the fitness-for-purpose of satellite multi-mission ocean color climate data records: A protocol applied to OC-CCI chlorophyll- a data. Remote Sensing of Environment 203:139–151.\n\nContingency Matrix\n\n\nUsing the linear trends calculated above, a contingency matrix was constructed to compare the agreement or disagreement of trends between the legacy and interim primary productivity products. Pixels were categorized by the matrix into three groups based on the sign of the slope.\n\n\n\nPostive trend: Increasing trend (positive slope).\n\n\nNegative trend: Decreasing trend (negative slope).\n\n\nNo significant trend: Slope not significantly different from zero.\n\n\nThe contingency matrix shows the percentage of pixels where the legacy and interim primary productivity products agree or disagree. The diagonal cells descending from left to right show where the products agree, and the off-diagonal cells show where the products disagree.\nThe contingency matrix is used to compute Cohen’s Kappa, a statistical measure that quantifies the level of agreement between the two NetPP products. Cohen’s Kappa accounts for the agreement occuring by chance and provides a standardized metric of similarity. The scale ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement)."
