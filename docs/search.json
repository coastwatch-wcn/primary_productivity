This metric provides validation that the interim netPP products can be reliably used for continuity in long-term productivity analyses.\nFor a detailed explanation of the calculation, see the Appendix.\n\nSpatial Variability in the Timeseries Monthly Mean ψ\n\n Figure 1. Global maps of the monthly mean unbiased relative difference (\\(\\bar{\\psi}_{lat/lon}\\)) comparing MODIS-Aqua with VIIRS-SNPP (top) and VIIRS-NOAA20 (bottom). Positive values indicate higher VIIRS estimates; negative values indicate lower VIIRS estimates.\n\nThe lighter blue and yellow regions in Fig. 1 suggest strong agreement between MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS netPP estimates, particularly in mid-latitude open ocean regions where differences are relatively small.

This approach helps determine whether VIIRS systematically overestimates or underestimates netPP compared to MODIS.\nThe pixel-by-pixel mean biased relative difference (Δrel) was created for the globe for each month at 9km resolution across two datasets.\nThe biased relative difference (ΔnetPP) is calculated for each pixel as follows:\n\n\n\\(\\Delta^{netPP} = \\frac{netPP_{VIIRS} - netPP_{MODIS}}{netPP_{MODIS}}\\)\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nThe difference between VIIRS-based netPP (netPPVIIRS) and MODIS-based netPP (netPPMODIS) values for that pixel is divided by netPPMODIS.\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Trends\nThe purpose of calculating linear trends for each of the datasets is to evaluate how much the products agree or disagree over time and across regions. Linear trends were calculated in the time series of monthly primary productivity for each pixel with either raw data or anomalies for the MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP, and VIIRS-NOAA20 datasets. Finding trends using raw data helps to analyze the absolute agreement in primary productivity estimates between the datasets, whereas calculating with anomalies enables us to focus on trends by removing seasonality. P-values were calculated to test the statistical significance of the trends for each pixel.\nThe trend analysis follows methods outlined in Melin et al. 2017, see the section 2.3 “Trend estimates and comparison of trends”.\n\n\nContingency Matrices\n\nUsing the linear trends calculated above, a contingency matrix was constructed to compare the agreement or disagreement of trends between the legacy and interim primary productivity products. Pixels were categorized by the matrix into three groups based on the sign of the slope.\n\n\nPostive trend: Increasing trend (positive slope).\n\n\nNegative trend: Decreasing trend (negative slope).\n\n\nNo significant trend: Slope not significantly different from zero.\n\n\nThe contingency matrix shows the percentage of pixels where the legacy and interim primary productivity products agree or disagree. The diagonal cells descending from left to right show where the products agree, and the off-diagonal cells show where the products disagree.\nThe contingency matrix is used to compute Cohen’s Kappa, a statistical measure that quantifies the level of agreement between the two NetPP products. Cohen’s Kappa accounts for the agreement occuring by chance and provides a standardized metric of similarity. The scale ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement)."

Primary productivity forms the base of the marine food web, supplying higher trophic levels and microbial food webs with an energy and carbon source. It also contributes to the release oxygen and uptake of carbon dioxide in the ocean and atmosphere, and plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Therefore, monitoring primary productivity is important for studying marine ecosystems, managing fisheries, and understanding global biogeochemical cycling."
