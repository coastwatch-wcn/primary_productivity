<h1> Why were we tasked with this project? (For Dale)</h1>

<h1> Why is primary productivity important?</h1>

- Foundation of the food chain
- Climate regulation & carbon cycle
- Controls fish stock abundance
- Fisheries management must account for primary production


<h1> Why do we need an interim product?</h1>

<p>The only available primary productivity satellite product from NOAA was developed by the CoastWatch West Coast Node in 2007. The product is based on the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VPGM) described by Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997) utilizing data from the MODIS sensor on the Aqua satellite.</p>

<p>However, the MODIS Aqua sensor will be decommissioned soon. While new primary productivity algorithms that use the latest satellite sensors are under development, they are unlikely to be in production before MODIS Aqua is retired. Therefore, an interim product is required to address the needs of users for primary productivity data during the gap between the loss of the legacy MODIS primary productivity and the availablity of the new generation primary productivity products.</p>

<p>Two interim primary productivity products, VIIRS SNPP and VIIRS NOAA20, are now available. Details on how these products were developed, can be found under the [Algorithm and Data](algorithm.qmd) tab.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Both interim products have undergone comprehensive statistical evaluation to ensure accuracy and reliability. The methods that were used to do so are found under the [Statistical Analysis](stats.qmd) tab.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
For users interested in conducting their own statistical analyses tailored to their region of interest will find Python notebooks in the [User Resources](user_resources.qmd) tab that provide step-by-step guidance.</p>
